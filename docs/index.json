    "keywords": "Filtering The Filtering is a method for organizing the results of your searches in the system. You can set your search criteria and we will show you only the matching results. The main benefits from Filtering are: Reducing the time to find what you need, as you are searching through less information; Reducing the load on the servers, networks, and on the client computers. You can Filter in two ways – on the server or on the client compiter (the user’s PC). Filtering on the server When you Filter the server , you will receive back less information. This means spending less time visualizing the data (especially for large amounts of data, when it can take up significantly more time) and it will reduce the load from the client computer and the network . To Filter on the server, set your criteria in the Search panel. You will find this method useful when searching for specific information in your daily work. If you need to review the criteria for the Filter, click on the View Filter button. An information box will appear under the Command Ribbon: You can set back a Filter to its default (program) settings by clicking on the Clear Filter button . This won’t delete the Filter completely, but rather reset it to its initial settings. Filtering on client’s computer When you Filter on a client computer , all the information is already downloaded from the server . And the Client computer is doing all the calculations (applying the criteria). You will find it useful for working with large amounts of various information (like for managerial analyses). This method allows you to Filter in two ways: Column Field value The two methods for filtering can also be combined by first applying Filters when loading data from the server and then using the client computer to find specific results. Row count You can also narrow down the received results by limiting the max row count . You can set this value by clicking on the Max row count field at the bottom left corner: To avoid overloading the server and networks, we advise you to go for the lowest row count possible, that will be enough to show the appropriate Reference. By default, the program’s Max row count is 2000. If the Reference contains over 2000 rows, the numbers in the report won’t be accurate. Timeout The Timeout option in the bottom left corner is another way of limiting the amount of data. It sets a time limit for the filtering to complete. If the time runs out before the end of the process, the application stops with no results. By default, the Timeout is 5 minutes. But loading an extensive Report can take up a lot of time . That’s when you can find it appropriate to extend the time limit. You can set this value by clicking on the Timeout field: When you set your criteria, you can start the search from the Command Ribbon >> Show Data . Refresh You use the Navigators to display data. In many cases, the output data isn’t created by the people responsible for it. This happens with auto-generated Documents , based on Document Flows. This way, people responsible for the payments do not take care of documents creation. The Sales and Invoices in the system create them automatically instead. Another example could be the warehouse orders. Sales generate them, not the person responsible for the warehouse. In this and plenty of other cases, the users need to see the latest data. You can ensure this by setting the Navigator to refresh automatically after a given time. For that purpose, from the Search panel, set the refresh interval for the Navigator (the number of seconds after loading the data, after which another data download starts). After you’ve downloaded the data, it will remain in focus at the top of the Navigator. The Navigator won’t refresh if you set the value to 0. You need to set individual timers for refreshing each Navigator . You can also set different timers when it’s needed. The Change Current View mode must be active to make those changes. The system offers the ability to save different views with default filters when filtering the server. Filters automatically load in such views. You can save filters only in named Views."

    "keywords": "Working with Fields The Fields are the smallest units of information in ERP.net Windows Desktop Client. Every Field contains information, describing its essence. Modify the fields to the way you need them in the Documents and Navigators – they could be hidden or visible, sorted in the order you created them, formatted according to the Form’s principles, or colored. You can edit the Fields in the Change Current View mode (you will find it automatically activated after choosing the Customize Fields function). Access the Customize Fields from the Command Ribbon >> View >> Customize Fields Or with right-click >> Customize Fields . With that, a new window opens up: On its left side ( All Fields ) you will find all Fields organized by panels in a tree. When you enable the Custom Properties checkbox, you will see it as a subsection of Documents and it includes the defined custom properties for that document, if there are any. The checkmark indicates visible Fields, while marks hidden Fields. With the Expand All button you can review all fields from the list. With the Expression Fields button, you can create and edit Expression Fields. On the right side, you can see a list of all Visible Fields. The program organizes them in the same way as you see them on screen. Against the name of the Field you will see its main settings – if it could be sorted, if it is accessible with Enter, if it is Required, and if it is Read Only. If you put a check on Enter, when you press Enter on the keyboard over a previous field, the cursor will move on to this field. When the checkmark is absent, you can access the Field by pressing Tab, the arrow keys, or a mouse click, but not with Enter – the cursor will skip this field and move on to the next Enter-enabled Field. If you set the Field to Required, it won’t be possible to release the Document until the Field is filled out. Some Fields are set to Required by the program, so you can’t remove the checkmark and make them not mandatory. If you mark a Field to ReadOnly, it can’t be edited. It will be visible, together with its value, but the user won’t be able to change it. Hiding and Revealing Fields You can review a Field by moving it from the All Fields to Visible Fields (from left to right). You can do this by double-clicking on the Field name or clicking this arrow: . If you need to hide a Field, double-click on it again or choose the analog command: . Reordering Fields You can reorder the Fields by dragging them to the needed position. Press the name of the Field in the Visible Fields list on the right and hold. Then drag it to the fitting place and let it go. You can also reorder the Fields with the move up and down buttons. Properties You can modify the visualization of data in the Panels. Select a Field name from the Fields Tree or the Visible Fields and click the Properties icon . You will see a new window opening: The checkmarks on top are the options we’ve looked into above. To set the field format (number, date), click on the three dots next to Display Format. In the new window, you can choose from the Standard Types in the program or create a custom one. You can choose the type of data on the left side of the window. You need to set Formats in the standard C# way – more information . When you set a format, the program loads a sample text in the “Sample” field, according to the chosen format. The sample may not reflect all aspects of the given format. Similarly, you can set the format for editting – what will be visible when you click the field. Click on the button next to Edit Format and proceed in the way described above. Security From the Security panel, you can choose the Security type of the Field, using a private access key or shared access key. By default, it will be not secured. Format Condition The Format Condition allows you to set up lines and Fields to turn a certain color if they face certain criteria. Open the Properties Form for the Field you need to modify and go to Format Condition; Put a check on “Enable Format Condition”; Choose the Condition that this field needs to face; Fill out Value 1 and optionally Value 2 if the value of the colored field needs to be in a certain interval (or outside of it); Set a color. You can make some other modifications (GradientMode, TextOptions…) if you check the Apply To Row box. This means that the entire row for that Field will be colored."

They are part of the forms, which contain information from different logical entities in ERP.net Windows Desktop Client. The panels are usually combined in regions. If you need to edit the Panels, the Customize Current View mode should be active. Note If you need to edit the Panels, the Customize Current View mode should be active. Showing and hiding panels If you would like to show or hide some Panels, go to Command Ribbon >> View >> Visible panels. The currently visible panels are marked with a tick in front of them. If you need to hide a panel, click on its name in the list – the panel will get hidden and the tick in the list will be removed. The procedure for showing panels is identical. Arranging panels You could move the panels from one region to another by dragging them. In a single region you could have more than one visible panels. Only one of the panels will be focused and its fields will be shown. If you would like focus another panel, you could click on its panel name. You will initially see the panel, which was visible when the View was saved. If you would like to change the initially visible panel, you could enter the Customize Current View mode, open the desired panel, and then save the change. You could set where in the region the panels’ names should appear. This happens when you right click the name of a panel within a region and select one of the options: Top, Left, Bottom, Right: If you select Left, the panel names will move from the top side to the left side of the region: In a similar way, you could position the panel names on the right or on the bottom of the region. Floating panels By default, the panels reside within a region in the main form. When necessary, you could pop the panel out in a special form. In such a case, they are called floating Panels. A panel becomes “floating” when you right click on its name and from the menu you select Floating window. Following is an example of a floating Panel: The floating Panels are separate windows and you could position it wherever needed, not taking the regions sizes and positions into account. If you would like to take the panel back to the main system’s form, right click the panel name and select Docked. If you save the View with floating Panels, these Panels will be floating again when the View is open."

    "title": "Working with views | ERP.net Windows Client",
    "keywords": "Working with views When working with the system, you may need to see the same information in different ways depending on the use case. This is why you can customize the system form’s appearance for it to fit your current needs. To protect your time, you can save the customized appearance under a specific name so that you can open it again later. This is called a View. The View is a specific named appearance of a system’s form. You could have multiple Views for the same form and each of them could be easily opened with a single mouse click. To customize the View, you need to have the form in the Customize Current View mode and possess the needed rights (in the current article we assume that you have the rights to perform the described actions). Selecting the desired View is done by clicking it in the Command Ribbon >> View. There is a list at the left hand side with all saved views (if there are any). The View is changed by clicking on the desired View: When there are more saved Views than the section can show (4, or 2 when the window is smaller), then the whole list could be seen by clicking the button . View types ERP.net has different types of Views – Standard and Named, for a User, Role or All Users. There are two Standard Views – one for All Users and one for the specific User. In the Standard View it is recommended to save the View that is needed most often. The Named Views are used for special use cases and there could potentially be an unlimited (but still reasonable) amount of them. The Views, created by a User (in brackets behind the name of a View you can see the User who created it), could be opened and edited only by that specific User. They are not visible to the rest of the users in the system (including administrators). The Views, assigned to a Role (in the form “View name (Role name)”) could be opened and edited by any user, who has that role assigned or by an administrator. The All Users Views could be opened by all users of the system and edited only by administrators. Saving views You can save your modified View using one of the following methods – by clicking the “Save layout changes” button or by using the “Save current view as…” option. The function “Save layout changes” is used by clicking the respective button in the View tab of the Command Ribbon. This way the changes are saved in the currently selected View. When it is necessary to save the changes in a View, different than the currently selected one, you could use the option “Save current view as…” from the Command Ribbon >> View >> More >> Save current view as… This option opens a new dialog window where you can set your saving preferences. If you would like the View to be named, click the respective “Named Layout” checkbox and give it a name. Otherwise, the View will be saved as a Standard View. If the View is not specifically saved, the system would ask if you would like to save it when closing the form. If not, the changes would be lost. More actions Other actions you could potentially perform with Views (from the Command Ribbon >> View >> More) Delete current view – deletes the currently selected view. This function is irreversible Restore default view – restores the Standard view View permissions – allows you to view and/or change the View permissions System view permissions – allows you to view and/or change the System view permissions Panel permissions – allows you to view and/or change the Panel permissions Load layout from file – works when there is a previously saved layout. The system applies it to the currently selected View of the form. It could only be used for the same form (which means you cannot load a Sales form View on the Invoices form) Save layout to file – saves the currently configured view in a file which could be sent over (via email or IM programs) and/or loaded in another database (for the same form)."
