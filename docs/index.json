The Change Current View mode is used to set the way Forms appear, while Edit Mode is about the information (data). Activating the Edit Mode allows you to edit that information. The two modes are not interconnected. You have separate access for them so that Change Current View mode could be off while Edit Mode is on or vice versa (furthermore, both modes could be active or not). By default, Documents open with active Edit Mode, while Navigators and Definitions open with the mode deactivated. You can set all Forms to open with active Edit Mode automatically, if needed. You need Edit Mode to be active to change the information in the Forms. You can activate or deactivate the mode in the Command Ribbon >> Home >> Edit Mode (or with hotkey F2 ). Note that not all Navigators have Edit Mode (Sales, Invoices, etc.)."

    "title": "GS1-128 Barcode command handler | ERP.net Windows Client",
    "keywords": "GS1-128 Barcode command handler GS1-128 is an application standard of the GS1 implementation using the code 128 barcode specification. In the past, GS1-128 was also known as UCC/EAN-128. GS1-128 uses a list of different application identifiers (AI) in order to include additional data such as quantity, lot and serial numbers and many others. In Version 2017, a new barcode command handler - GS1-128 is introduced. Based on the GS1-128 standard, it includes several of its application identifiers. In more detail, the AI recognised by GS1-128 handler are: (01) Global Trade Item Number (GTIN), (02) GTIN of Contained Trade Items, (10) Batch/Lot Number, (21) Serial Number, (37) Number of Units Contained. When used/ recognised, those identifiers input values in one of the following fields (Table1): Code Description Program field 01 Global trade item number (GTIN) 02 GTIN of contained trade items Product 10 Batch Lot Number Lot 21 Serial number Serial Number 37 Number of units contained Quantity (In the Quantity unit of the Coding system) (Table1) List of application identifiers recognised by the GS1-128 handler The operation of the GS1-128 barcode commands handler is explained in the next steps, fully describing its working process. Step 1 The system attempts to split the scanned text into segments of the following format ‘(xxx ... x) yyy ... y’. Where ‘xxx ... x’ would contain at least two characters (‘xxx ... x’ will be referred to in the text as ‘segment code’) and ‘yyy ... y’ is a non-empty text. Both ‘xxx ... x’ and ‘yyy ... y’ do not need to contain brackets ‘(‘ or ‘)’. If the text cannot be separated into those segments, \\the reading by the GS1-128 handler fails and the system does not continue the next steps. For example , the text (02)TEST00012479222(10)L00028(37)5 is split into segments (02)TEST00012479222, (10)L00028 и (37)5. In the first segment ‘xxx...x’ is ‘02’ and ‘ ‘yyy...y’ is TEST00012479222.. and so on. For texts like 22503(01)54030893330, ()22503(01)54030893330, (01)805485305840)4584, (1)8HHJ4584(01)PRD442607224 or (02)453893890899(10), the reading fails. Step 2 From the segments which are a result of the previous step, only those with a segment code 01, 02, 10, 21 or 37 are taken into consideration. The remaining segments are neglected and do not participate in the next steps. For example, if the text is (02)TEST00012479222(10)L00028(12)6646(21)KKE334(22)DW634(37)5(329y)798454, segments (02)TEST00012479222, (10)L00028 и (37)5 are going to be used in the next steps and segments (12)6646, (21)KKE334, (22)DW634 и (329y)798454 are going to be neglected. Step 3 Certain validations for compatibility between codes (xxx ... x s) of the segments are made in this step. If any of the validations finds that the text is invalid, then reading by the GS1-128 handler fails and the system does not continue the next steps. Validations: Each of the segment codes 01, 02, 10, 21 or 37 can be part of only one of the segments in the text. For example , texts like (02)HJ453494573945(37)12, (10)LОТ55490380934(21)455340300303 and (02)TEST00012479222(10)L00028(12)6646(21)KKE334(22)DW634(37)5(329y)798454 are valid commands, while (02)HJ453494573945(37)12(37)445(329y)798454 and (01)45373532234BBA98(01)YYE436373(10)LOT17 are not. The text needs to contain at least one segment with code 01 or 02. For example , texts like (01)45373532234BBA98 and (02)HJ453494573945(37)12 are valid, while (10)LОТ55490380934(21)455340300303 is not. The text does not have to contain segments with segment codes 01 and 02 simultaneously. For example , (01)45373532234BBA98 and (02)HJ453494573945(37)12 are valid texts, while (10)LОТ55490380934(21)455340300303 is not; If the text contains a segment with code 37, then it must also contain a segment with code 02. For example , (02)HJ453494573945(37)12 is a valid text, while (01)HJ453494573945(37)12 is not. If any of the validations find that the text is invalid, then the reading by the GS1-128 handler fails and the system DOES not continue the next steps. Step 4 In step 4, the recognition of products and/or lots, serial numbers and quantities through the ‘yyy ... y’ parts of the segments is performed. First, the system finds the part ‘yyy ... y’ of the segment with one of the following codes 01 or 02 (whichever is available in the text). For this value, the system searches for a product, as it usually does when a barcode panel is used. If it finds such a product – a new record with the recognised product is created in the input data table. The input data table contains the records according to which the lines of the document/report are going to be created after performing the operation. If the text contains a segment with code 10, its ‘yyy ... y’ part is used for the recognition of a lot (as standardly done in the barcode panel). If the system finds such a lot, it is saved in the already generated record in the lines of the document/ report (if the record in the input data table was not created after the search for the product – it is created now). The same happens with a segment with code 21 – through its ‘yyy ... y’ part the system searches for a serial number and if such is found, it needs to be inputted in the record (if the record in the input data table was not created after the search for the product – it is created now). And if there is a segment with a code 37, its ‘yyy ... y’ part is converted to a positive integer. If this is possible, the value is inputted in the field Quantity of the generated record. The system searches for the coding system with which the record is added and also inputs its default unit in the Quantity unit field (if the record in the input data table was not created after the search for the product – it is created now). If the ‘GS1-128’ handler has failed during some of the steps, then the system proceeds to the next handler of the list (the whole text is transmitted to the next handler). If ‘GS1-128’ did not fail and the product, the lot, the serial number and the quantity are successfully retrieved (filled in the input record), the system does nothing much. i.e. does not proceed to subsequent handlers in the list. And if any of the product, lot, serial number or quantity is not extracted (for example, because a product with this barcode/part number is not found in the base), then the system proceeds to the following handles which can be able to fill in the empty values."

    "keywords": "Fast barcode panel commands For convenience, there is a predefined command list with ‘easy-access’ commands that are recognized by the Barcode panel. The full list is available in the ERP.net client through the Command list button in the Barcode tab . The list contains fast command codes/strings and their corresponding barcode labels i.e. the commands can be entered manually or scanned from the barcode labels. The list can be printed and attached to the working area, so it can be easily accessible during daily work with the barcode scanner. The list contains commands allowing to add specific quantity for a product, entering a line, changing the serial number modes in the panel, and others. List of fast commands Quantity commands: *, which resets the entered quantity. q*, where ‘q’ is a number i.e. 1, 10, 50, 500..: q* adds the entered number (q) to the current value of the Barcode panel’s Quantity field. When scanned in combination with a product code (q*productCode), it adds a new line with the entered product and quantity equal to entered number(q). Note The barcodes for some of the most frequently used quantities are available in the predefined list that can be downloaded from the Command list button in the barcode tab ERP.net Client. If the desired quantity is present in this list, then it can be directly scanned. Otherwise, it must be marked as the sum of existing quantities. For this purpose, the quantities are sequentially scanned until the desired number is reached. Example: We want to execute 52 PCS of product code ‘0001’. Method 1 : We can scan the product label and consequently the quantity barcodes from the command list for ‘50*’ and end then for ‘2*’. The final quantity is 50 + 2, which is exactly 52; Method 2: We can scan the product label and then manually enter the command ‘52*’. Method 3: We can manually enter the command ‘52*0001’ Operational commands: #ADD# - Adds the data entered in the Barcode panel as a new line e.g. new document line, input data line, etc. #CLEAR# - Clears all value from the fields in the Barcode panel. #SKIP# - Skips the entering of lot or serial number and adds the data entered in the Barcode panel as a new line. #UNDO# - Deletes the last line (new document line, input data line, etc.) created through the Barcode panel. #FINISH# - Completes the data entering and creates a new document. It is available only for functional navigators. Serial number commands: #SERIAL# - Switches to Serial number mode used for entering a single serial number. #LIST# - Switches to LIST of serial numbers mode used for entering serial numbers until the # ADD # command is executed. #RNGSTART# - Switches to RANGE START of serial numbers mode used for entering the starting serial number when creating a range of serial numbers. #RNGEND# - Switches to RANGE END of serial numbers mode used for entering the ending serial number when creating a range of serial numbers. #SEQSTART# - Switches to SEQUENCE START of serial numbers mode used for entering the starting serial number when creating a sequence of serial numbers. #SEQEND# - Switches to SEQUENCE END of serial numbers mode used for entering of the count of numbers when creating a sequence of serial numbers."

    "keywords": "Barcode commands A barcode label is a special symbol to represent human readable information such as a product number or a lot number in machine readable format. In ERP.net barcode labels could be used through the Barcode commands panel. This panel allows very quick and operational work with barcode labels via barcode reader in the forms containing product lines. The product can be added in the lines by using their product name, part number or a product code (using coding systems). Information such as quantity , lot or serial number can also be inputted. The barcode tab The Barcode tab is accessible only if the Barcode commands panel is visible in the view. It contains several buttons which rebound to the work of the panel, but it also contains a Settings button. When pressed, it opens the Settings window where we can edit the list of barcode command handlers with different options (such as ‘Use lots’, for example) which are or can be activated. Note It is very important to remember that barcode settings are individually set for each view. The selected options are saved in the view. There is also a Command list button for convenience, loading a list with ‘easy-access’ commands that are recognized by the panel. For more information, see Fast barcode panel commands . Barcode commands handlers Different barcode command handlers by which the information from the barcode label is recognized can be activated from the barcode settings in the Barcode tab . Currently, there are three types of handlers: General (quantity, product name) , Other ( GS1-128 command handler , Mettler Toledo / EAN-13 BPRO) and Coding systems (user-defined). Barcode commands are handled only by the active command handlers in the specified order. The active command handler list can be reordered using drag and drop. Barcode panel options Two additional options can also be activated from the barcode settings in the Barcode tab : If ‘Use lots’ is on, when the system recognizes the product (if the product is allowed or required to use lots), it does not create a line immediately, but changes the barcode panel mode and waits until information about the lot number is received. The lot number can be added via a barcode label, manually in the main field or from the drop-down list in the lot field. If ‘Use serial numbers’ is on, when the system recognizes the product (if the product is serialized), it does not create a line immediately, but changes the barcode panel mode and waits until information about the serial number is received. The lot number can be added via barcode label and manually in the main field or in the serial number field. Barcode panel modes The barcode panel supports multiple modes which allow entering quantities, lots and serial numbers. For more information, see Barcode panel modes ."

Note There is a separate subtopic for each mode giving more details about its usage and operation. Form types and mode selection Some of the modes are available only when the current form is in a specific type. There are three types: ‘Receive’, ‘Issue or ‘Indefinite’. The current form type could be seen after refreshing the Movement Type button in the Barcode tab . Generally, the form types are defined by whether all lines in the Main lines panel are for receiving goods, for issuing goods or for both. Usually, the direction of the document forms is pretty clear. Sales orders , for example, are ‘Issue’ type forms and purchase orders are ‘Receive’ type forms. The situation is a bit more complicated when the form is actually a navigator, such as Execute store orders . This navigator could contain both ‘Receive’ and ‘Issue’ lines. In those cases, the form type depends on the filtering. If the we have applied such filters that in the navigator lines there are only lines with a ‘receipt’ direction , then the form type is ‘Receive’ and vice versa. If in the navigator are loaded lines with both directions, the form type is ‘Indefinite’. Barcode modes can be selected: manually - the user can switch between the different modes from the drop-down list in the main field of the panel. automatically - for the serial number modes, there is also an automatic switching between modes. The switching is activated as the selection of the product is mostly influenced by the value of the Default mode for serial numbers input field in the Barcode panel settings. For more information about the automatic switching between modes, please see the topic of the particular mode. by entering a fast command - the modes for a single serial number, list, range or a sequence of serial numbers could also be selected using a fast command.

It is used for entering a count of numbers when a sequence of an exact count of serial numbers starting from a particular number is created. For entering a start serial number, use SEQUENCE START of serial numbers (from ... count) Example: We want to create 5 serial numbers starting from serial number ‘XB0008’. In this case, we could: Note The product has already been selected manually or through the Main mode . Method 1: Select the SEQUENCE START mode and enter the starting number ’XB0008’.

    "keywords": "Document command ribbon The command ribbon in a document system form contains both the primary functions for all system forms and some commands that are specific for this type of a form. Home tab Here is how the Home tab looks like: It contains both the standard functionalities that are present in other system forms and some specific functions. An example of a specific function that is only available in the home tab is Start: An example of a function that you can find in other forms as well is Print: Other features of the Home document page are: Save – saves the entered information; Undo – reverses the changes you’ve made so far (changes that you haven’t saved yet); Save & New – saves the information in the current document and loads a new one; Edit Mode – allows you to edit the data in the form; Print – prints out the document; States – shows the state of completion for the current document; Context menu - displays a list of commands, related to a selected system form element. You can also open the context menu by right-clicking on the element. The first component in the Context menu is the Definition of the selected element. For example, when you click on the Customer field (in the Header of the Offer Document), the name of the selected item (in this case, the customer’s name) will appear in the context menu. This way, when selected, the context menu will show the definition form of the currently selected customer. When the document is in a New state, this function provides the following opportunities: Connect to Customer – connects you to the customer with the data that is already entered in the program; Select from navigator – allows you to select a value for that field from the navigator; More : Create new for Customer – create a record for the current field; Refresh display values (F9) – refresh the values for the drop menu of the current field; Create form Internet – automatically retrieves all the data for a given company from the Internet, by entering the VAT number. Choosing another field from the Header, which has a definition, will cause the elements of the context menu to change. For example, when clicking on the Document Type field in the Document panel. Data tab The Data tab includes: Cut – removes the selected text and temporarily copies it to the clipboard. It moves the data from their initial location to a new one. This function is most commonly used for corrections; Copy – copies the selected text and temporarily copies it to the clipboard. This function allows you to easily type in the same data multiple times; Paste – puts the text you just copied where you need it; Find – searches for a word or a number in documents, navigators or reports. Copy and Cut are useful when you want to save yourself the time to reapply the same data, and to avoid mistakes, while filling out the information. For example, through copying the names of people and companies, you save time by not typing them out, while eliminating the rick of mistakes. Paste Top Cell – you can use this function to quickly edit multiple records in a table panel. It applies the value of the top cell to the ones below it; Export to Excel – available only for the Document Forms and the Navigators. Clicking on it will export all the selected rows to Excel. This function can only be used for tabular data. Therefore, it is available only in the navigators, reports or in the panels of a document form that contains information in tabular form (For example, Sales Order in the Sales Document) Calculator – they do not carry new information and we don’t save their values in your database. Those are fields with real-time calculated values (after opening the Form). They are used for working with already existing data with a set criterion, recalculating the data with a different formula. View tab This tab contains tools for changing the appearance of the document. This includes showing/hiding shared panels common for all documents. Current view – shows the different types of views; Customize Current View – allows you to edit system forms; Customize Fields – serves for editing, showing and hiding the properties and settings of panels; Save layout changes – saves the changes you’ve made on the view; Discard layout changes – resets the view back to its initial look; Open in separate window – opens the form in a separate window; More – contains a set of functions related to saving and deleting a view, restoring it to its default state, as well as setting the access rights to certain views for a given user. Visible panels – shows or hides panels in the view; Close – closes the current Form; In the Navigators, the View tab has another section for visual settings: The additional functions of the Navigators are: Filter row – shows a row, where you can set your search criteria; Freeze columns – fixes a column that does not shift when scrolled horizontally. The columns in front of it also remain static. This way you can overlap columns without changing up the View. Record Navigation – shows and hides the navigation buttons from the lower left corner. You can use these buttons to scroll through consecutive records or pages. Cell Selection Mode – allows you to switch between two modes. When this mode is deactivated, you will be selecting the entire rows in the Navigators. But if it’s active, you will be able to select single or multiple fields. Functions tab The functions tab of the document form has various functions for each type of Documents, depending on its application and in what module it is (invoice, purchase, sale, warehouse receipt, report…) Here are the two most common functions among the types of document forms: Send as link – this function provides you with two methods to send an E-mail – sending via link or mailing the Document as a PDF format; Calculate additional document amounts – this function calculates and distributes additional amounts throughout the rows in the Document. Reports tab Here you can design views. The idea is to have a universal system for creating a printout for requests. It contains various templates for each table in the data source. When you open a navigator, a default value is set. So, when you enter through a navigator panel and create a new report, the query on that panel loads. Here is how the tab looks like: Document tab The Document tab contains the following sub-menus and functions: • Adjustment Documents - shows you the list of corrected documents that were previously created for this document • Versions - shows the versions of a document before and after any changes or adjustments were made • Create New from Current - creates a copy of the document. The new document will be with the current date, but it will also consist of the data in the original document • Duplicate - gives you the opportunity to create a duplicate of the original document which will have the status New and the opportunity to be changed. If you have a type of document that has a numerator, the duplicate creates a new number. • Create Adjustment - gives you the opportunity to create an adjustment document. • Create Adjustment to Zero - allows you to create an adjustment document with values that resets all quantitative and fields of values Relations tab In this tab, you can see generated, canceled or transit sub-documents (if any) for the current document. You will also find the sub-documents that you can manually create for this Document."

    "keywords": "Document flow The document flow describes the hierarchy of a given process - the order in which you create the documents. It has only one document for a start – the master document , and a variety of child documents that you create from the master document. According to its place in the document flow (and the current document), you can set almost every document to be a master, parent or child document. Master document The master document is a document that initiates a given process. It is an absolute category, and it does not depend on the current document. It is not created by other documents (it does not have a parent document). The master document is only one for every process. Parent document Parent document is a document that you can use to create another document. It is a relative category, and it depends on the current document. You can use the parent document as a child document for another document. The documents usually have only one parent document. It is possible for you to connect one document to other documents in the document flow, but these documents will not be real parent documents. The master document is a parent document for the documents that you have created right under its level. For example: in the document route A > B > C, A is the parent for B, B is the parent of C. Child documents Child documents are documents that you create from another document. It is a relative category and these documents depend on the current document. Documents might have a variety of child documents. The child document can be a parent document for another document. For example: In the document route A > B > C, B is a child document of A, C is a child document of B. B can also be seen as the parent document of C. Relations menu in the command ribbon You can also see the hierarchy of documents not only in the document flow but also in the relations menu in the command ribbon. We have optimized it for work with touch and to provide quick access to the documents in the flow. The master document is at the far left part of the command ribbon - we have separated it from the rest with an arrow. The parent document is right after the master document. We have marked the master and parent document with an arrow pointing upwards. The child documents are at the right part of the separation line after the parent document. We have marked the child documents’ icons with an arrow pointing downwards. You can move to a more distant branch of the structure (child document of a child document or a parent document of a parent document) by clicking on the lower part (the name and arrow next to it). A list of the child documents will display (or of the parent documents respectively). This way, you can look through the entire tree. Document flow You can view the document flow in the document flow panel. The panel is standard for all document types. It consists of a tree structure of all the documents, starting with the current one. To open a document from the Document flow, right-click on the desired document and select “Open document”. When you right-click on a document you can also: Show Void Documents – if you select that, the voided documents will display as well; Show Transitional Documents - if you check that option, the transitional documents will display as well; Refresh – refreshes the document flow. The structure of the document flow begins from the current document. Under every document, you can see its child documents. In order to see the parent document, you have to press the expand button in front of “Created By”. The master document is the document that does not have an expand button in front of “Created By”. The document flow panel is convenient for a quick overview of the document flow."

    "title": "Document state | ERP.net Windows Client",
    "keywords": "Document state Document state is a system characteristic that shows you at what stage of completion your document is. The document state has a business meaning, as well as a specific to the program meaning. The additional business meaning can come from the user state. The document system state can be: New - every new manually created document initially has a new state. This document acts as a draft and traditionally no actions will be initiated by the program for it; Firm Planned - this is a document, usually automatically created by the system, which usually needs additional processing. Such documents show events with a possible, but uncertain nature . You can use the documents with the firm planned state in the planning subsystem of ERP.net Windows Desktop Client. The system will delete these documents after they are planned; Confirmed - this is a document, confirmed by an authorized user of the system. It has a probable nature. The confirmed documents reflect the intention for a future release of the document. This is taken into consideration by the system and it does not delete them after they are planned; Released - a document that is released for execution. The released state has a specific meaning in the system. It notes that the document has gained its final form and the system forbids any edits, including changing its state to a lower one. You can use the released state to start a sequence of system actions. This allows you to create sub-documents; Completed - this shows the completion of the active work on the document; Closed - this allows you to see the completion of the entire work on a specific document (process). By using the closed state, you can optimize the speed of your work by selecting to work only with the open documents in the system; Adjustment - you can only use this state for a document that is an adjustment of another one. By selecting this state, you put the adjustment document into action; Void . Changing state You can change the state of a document from the Command Ribbon >> Home by clicking on the desired state. If you need to change the document’s user state, click on the arrow under the appropriate state and choose the desired option. Voiding ERP.net Windows Desktop Client has proven its security and reliability as a system. We do not allow information loss of any form. Part of this concept is the inability to delete documents irreversibly and completely. When necessary, you can void a document. This will save a copy in the database, but it won’t display is the Definitions (unless you specify that you need to see those copies). Void has three variations – Void (only the current document); Void with sub-documents (if their state is lower than released); Void with sub-documents, including released. The necessity for those variations comes from safety precautions. If a given user can void any document, this may affect the work of other departments (warehouse, finance, accounting). Users can only void documents they have rights to. Users are not able to void sub-documents without having those rights. When you select to void a document, the system will open a new window first, asking for the reason for voiding this document: If the system does not allow voiding a document, the likely reasons are: The user does not have the right to void a document. The solution to this problem is giving that user the required rights or making another user execute the voiding operation. Branched flow - it is possible that the document connects to other sub-documents indirectly. In this situation, you need to void the connected sub-documents first (for example, those branches result from selling products through the Navigator). Completing Completed – this State marks the completion of the document. You cannot set the document’s state to completed if any of its sub-documents are in a state lower than released. This preventive function serves as protection. By default, completed documents will not be visible in the Navigators, unless you specifically set them to display in the reports. The Completion has three variations – Complete (only for the current document), Complete with sub-documents (if the sub-documens are in a state not lower than released), Complete with sub-documents, including unreleased . The necessity for those variations comes from safety precautions. If a user has the right to complete documents from the flow, this can affect the work of other departments (warehouse, finances, accounting). Users can only complete the documents that they have the right to. They cannot complete sub-documents that they do not have the rights to. When a given user tries to complete a document, the system will automatically stop this process if there is a conflict, such as unfinished sub-documents. When you are completing the current document, the system will check whether you have completed the sub-documents (they have released state). If you have completed them and the user has the required rights, then the process is going to be ready for completion. If they are not, you will see an error and you have to clear it (complete the sub-document) in order to complete the current document."

The following functions are supported CONVERT() Converts an expression of one data type to another. This function is very useful if we want to use custom properties values in calculations. We can use all data types which are available in the dropdown list in the Expression fields editor. Data types must be used in the following format 'System.DataType' - they have to be preceded by 'System' and have to be enclosed in single quotation marks (''). Note All conversions are valid with the following exceptions: Boolean can be converted to and from integer , string and itself only. DateTime can be converted to and from string and itself only. Syntax: Convert (expression, type), where: expression - The expression to convert. Example: CONVERT([LinesTotal], 'System.Decimal'). LEN() Gets the length of a string. Syntax : LEN( expression ), where: expression - The string to be evaluated. Example: Len([ProductDescription]) If the product description is ‘White paper’, the function will return 11. ISNULL() Checks an expression and either returns it or gives a replacement value. Syntax: ISNULL(expression, replacementvalue), where: expression - The expression to check. replacementvalue - If expression is null, a replacement value is returned. Example: IsNull([UnitPrice], 0.00) If the unit price is 12.00, then the function returns 12.00. If the unit price is not filled in, it returns 0.00. IIF() Gets one of two values depending on the result of a logical expression. Syntax: IIF(expr, truepart, falsepart), where: expr - The expression to evaluate. truepart - The value to return if the expression is true. falsepart - The value to return if the expression is false. Example: IIF([LineAmount]>1000, 'Eligible for discount', 'No discount') If the Line amount is 2000.00, the function returns ‘Eligible for discount’. If the Line amount is 800.00, the function returns ‘No discount’. TRIM() Removes all leading and trailing blank characters. Syntax: TRIM(expression), where: expression - The expression that will be trimmed. Example: TRIM([Notes]) If the note is ‘The warranty is sold separately. ‘, the function will return ‘The warranty is sold separately.’. SUBSTRING() Gets a sub-string of a specified length, starting at a specified point in the string. Syntax: SUBSTRING(expression, start, length), where: expression - The source string for the substring. start - An integer that defines where the substring starts. length - An integer that defines the length of the substring.

    "keywords": "Expression fields Expression fields are user-defined fields that can be created in different forms in the database. With them, users can create calculated columns, which contain a value calculated from other columns or from the column values of multiple rows in the table. Аt first glance, еxpression fields and calculated attributes , which are introduced in Version 2017, have a similar purpose, but the calculated attributes are recommended for advanced users. Unlike them, expression fields can’t be used by user business rules . Like regular system fields, expression fields can be managed from the ‘Customise fields’ form. The expression fields have the following properties: Field name - the unique name of the expression fields; only latin letters and digits are accepted; Caption - the display name of the field; it is multi-language; Expression - numbers, symbols and operators or functions grouped together, which yields a new value by performing calculations, comparisons, or other operations; Running total - when activated, the sequence of numbers is summed and updated progressively, by adding the value of the new number to the previous running total; Data type - a format that contains the specific type of the value: boolean, integer, decimal, string, DateTime or unset. Expressions The term expression is synonymous with formula . In order to define an expression that needs to be evaluated in the system, we can use the Expression editor . An expression consists of a number of possible elements that you can use, alone or in combination, to produce a result. Those elements include: Identifiers - the names of table fields. In the editor, we can refer to a target field in the expressions by its ‘Field name’ surrounded by square brackets without spaces; Operators - such as + (plus) or - (minus). For more information, see Expression fields - operators ; Functions - such as IFF or ISNULL. For more information, see Expression fields - functions ; Constants - values that do not change, such as strings of text, or numbers that are not calculated by an expression."

    "title": "Operators | ERP.net Windows Client",
    "keywords": "Operators Every expression consists of at least one operand and can have one or more operators. Operands are values, whereas operators are symbols that represent particular actions. When we create comparison expressions, the following operators are allowed '<' - Less than operator Returns True if the left operand is less than the right operand. Example : 3 < 4 // true '>' - Greater than operator Returns True if the left operand is greater than the right operand. Example : 4 > 3 // true '<=' - Less than or equal to operator Returns True if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand. Example : 3 <= 4 // true 3 <= 3 // true '>=' - Greater than or equal operator Returns True if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand. Example : 4 >= 3 // true 3 >= 3 // true '<>' – Inequality operator Returns True if the operands do not have the same value; otherwise, it returns False. Example : 4 <> 3 // true '=' – Equality operator Returns True if both operands have the same value; otherwise, it returns False. Example : 3 = 3 // true In(,,,) - IN operator Tests if the column value is equal to any one of a specified set of values. It is useful when you want to compare a column with more than one value. It is similar to an OR condition. Syntax: expression In ( value1, value2, …), where: - *expression* - expression identifying the field that contains the data you want to evaluate; - *value1, value2* - *expression* or list of expressions against which you want to evaluate the *expression*. If the expression is found in the list of values, the In operator returns True; otherwise, it returns False. Note If we are using characters or dates list items, they must be enclosed in single quotation marks (''). Example: [Quantity]In(1, 2, 5 ) The operator will return True for the rows where the quantity is either of '1', ‘2’ or ‘5’; otherwise, it returns False. Like() - LIKE operator Tests if the column value is similar to specified character(s). The LIKE operator is used to list all rows in a table whose column values match a specified pattern. It is useful when you want to search rows to match a specific pattern, or when you do not know the entire value. Syntax: expression Like (' pattern '), where: - *expression* - expression identifying the field that contains the data you want to evaluate; - *pattern* - string or character string literal against which *expression* is compared. Note If we are using characters or dates list items, they must be enclosed in single quotation marks (‘). The following table shows how you can use Like to test expressions for different patterns. Kind of match Pattern Match(returns True) No match(returns False) Multiple character a*a aa, Aba, aBBBa Abc ab abc AABB Xab aZb, bac Special character a[*]a a*a aaa Multiple characters ab* abcdefg, abc cab, aab Single character a?a aaa, a3a, aBa aBBBa Single digit a#a a0a, a1a, a2a aaa, a10a Range of characters [a-z] f, p, i 2, & Outside a range [!a-z] 9,&,% b, a Not a digit [!0-9] A. a. &, ~ 0, 1, 9 Combined a[!B-M]# An9,az0, a99 abc, aj0 Concatenation is allowed using Boolean AND, OR, and NOT operators. The AND operator has precedence over other operators. For example: (LastName = 'Smith' OR LastName = 'Jones') AND FirstName = 'John' To concatenate a string, use the + character. The following arithmetic operators are also supported in expressions: \"+ (addition) \" - Adds the value of one numeric expression to another, or concatenates two strings. \"- (subtraction) \" - Finds the difference between two numbers. \"* (multiplication) \" - Multiplies the value of two expressions. \"/ (division) \" - Divides the first operand by the second. \"% (modulus) \" - Returns the remainder (modulus) obtained by dividing one numeric expression into another."

Thus, the system would locate those values no matter where the word typed in the bar stands in the name. Take, as an example the ‘OOD’ abbreviation entered in the search bar with a ‘space’ before.The system would locate all the clients registered as a private limited company.

    "keywords": "Filtering The Filtering is a method for organizing the results of your searches in the system. You can set your search criteria and we will show you only the matching results. The main benefits from Filtering are: Reducing the time to find what you need, as you are searching through less information; Reducing the load on the servers, networks, and on the client computers. You can Filter in two ways – on the server or on the client compiter (the user’s PC). Filtering on the server When you Filter the server , you will receive back less information. This means spending less time visualizing the data (especially for large amounts of data, when it can take up significantly more time) and it will reduce the load from the client computer and the network . To Filter on the server, set your criteria in the Search panel. You will find this method useful when searching for specific information in your daily work. If you need to review the criteria for the Filter, click on the View Filter button. An information box will appear under the Command Ribbon: You can set back a Filter to its default (program) settings by clicking on the Clear Filter button . This won’t delete the Filter completely, but rather reset it to its initial settings. Filtering on client’s computer When you Filter on a client computer , all the information is already downloaded from the server . And the Client computer is doing all the calculations (applying the criteria). You will find it useful for working with large amounts of various information (like for managerial analyses). This method allows you to Filter in two ways: Column Field value The two methods for filtering can also be combined by first applying Filters when loading data from the server and then using the client computer to find specific results. Row count You can also narrow down the received results by limiting the max row count . You can set this value by clicking on the Max row count field at the bottom left corner: To avoid overloading the server and networks, we advise you to go for the lowest row count possible, that will be enough to show the appropriate Reference. By default, the program’s Max row count is 2000. If the Reference contains over 2000 rows, the numbers in the report won’t be accurate. Timeout The Timeout option in the bottom left corner is another way of limiting the amount of data. It sets a time limit for the filtering to complete. If the time runs out before the end of the process, the application stops with no results. By default, the Timeout is 5 minutes. But loading an extensive Report can take up a lot of time . That’s when you can find it appropriate to extend the time limit. You can set this value by clicking on the Timeout field: When you set your criteria, you can start the search from the Command Ribbon >> Show Data . Refresh You use the Navigators to display data. In many cases, the output data isn’t created by the people responsible for it. This happens with auto-generated Documents , based on Document Flows. This way, people responsible for the payments do not take care of documents creation. The Sales and Invoices in the system create them automatically instead. Another example could be the warehouse orders. Sales generate them, not the person responsible for the warehouse. In this and plenty of other cases, the users need to see the latest data. You can ensure this by setting the Navigator to refresh automatically after a given time. For that purpose, from the Search panel, set the refresh interval for the Navigator (the number of seconds after loading the data, after which another data download starts). After you’ve downloaded the data, it will remain in focus at the top of the Navigator. The Navigator won’t refresh if you set the value to 0. You need to set individual timers for refreshing each Navigator . You can also set different timers when it’s needed. The Change Current View mode must be active to make those changes. The system offers the ability to save different views with default filters when filtering the server. Filters automatically load in such views. You can save filters only in named Views."

    "title": "Period expressions | ERP.net Windows Client",
    "keywords": "Period expressions To limit the amount of visible records, you can filter by period , which contains a date in the document (date of the document, due date, delivery date, task completion date). You can find this option in the filtering panel in all of the navigators in the field “Period for XXXX”. If the needed field does not show in the standard view, you can enable/show it first. To elaborate, you can set expressions for days, months and years in the following ways: Absolute expressions for periods - set an absolute (fixed, specific) period Relative expressions for periods - set a period relative to the current date Mixed expressions for periods - they contain an absolute and a relative expression together Graphic editor – allows you to choose from a calendar The period will present itself as Starting date and End date in the fields “From XXXX” and “To XXXX” when you set a period in one of these ways. Absolute expressions The absolute expressions for periods set the day, the month and eventually the year’s absolute value in an absolute (fixed, specific) expression (for example: 31.01.2021). If you do not set a year, the absolute expression takes the current one. Their general appearance is: Month Month.Year .Year Day,Month.Year Examples for specific dates : If you need to enter “March”, write “3” in the Period field. If you need to enter “March, 2021”, write “3.21” in the Period field. If you need to enter “March 31, 2021”, write “31.3.21” in the Period field. Examples for entire periods : If you need to enter the period “from the beginning of January this year to the end of March this year), enter period “1..3”. If you need to enter the period “from the beginning of January 2021 to the end of March 2021”, enter period “1.21..3.21”. Relative expressions You use the relative expressions to define a date relative to the current date (last week, 4 days ago…). There are two types of relative expressions - predefined and relative. The predefined expressions consist of service words which directly tell the program what period to take. They are: today, (t), (d) : Today. (yesterday), (y) : Yesterday. (thisweek), (tw) : This week, starting from Monday. (lastweek), (lw) : Last week. (thismonth), (tm) : This month. (lastmonth), (lm) : Last month. (thisyear), (ty) : This year. (lastyear), (ly) : Last year. (yeartodate), (ytd) : The year starting from its beginning until today. (lastyeartodate), (lytd) : The last year starting from its beginning until today. Keep in mind that there is a difference in interpreting the predefined periods (week, month). When you set them as a Starting date, the system takes the beginning of the period (for example Monday or the first date of the month). When you set them as an end date, the system takes the end of the period (for example Friday, the last date of the month or 31st of December). Examples: If you need “today”, enter “(t)”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From March 2, 2021 to March 2, 2021”. If you need “yesterday”, enter “(y)”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From March 1, 2021 to March 1, 2021”. If you need “this week”, enter “(tw)”. If today were March 2, 2021 – Tuesday, it would translate to ”From March 1, 2021 (Monday) to March 7, 2021”. If you need “last week”, enter “(lw)”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From February 22, 2021 to February 28, 2021”. If you need “this month”, enter “(tm)”. If today were January 1, 2021, it would translate to “From January 1, 2021 to January 31, 2021”. If you need “last month”, enter “(lm)”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From February 1, 2021 to February 28, 2021”. If you need “this year”, enter “(ty)”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021”. If you need “last year”, enter “(ly)”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020”. If you need “year to date”, enter “(ytd)”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From January 1, 2021 to March 2, 2021”. If you need “last year to date”, enter \"(lytd)\" . If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From January 1, 2020 to March 2, 2020”. Relative periods - they will set the period as the difference in the number of days (default expression - d), weeks (w), months (m) or years (y) to the current date. +xd - from date, x days after the current one; -xd - from date, x days before the current one; +xw - from date, x weeks after the current one; -xw - from date, x weeks before the current one; +xm - from date, x weeks after the current one; -xm - from date, x weeks before the current one; +xy - from date, x weeks after the current one; -xy - from date, x weeks before the current one. Examples: If you need the date “tomorrow”, enter “+1d”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From March 3, 2021 to March 3, 2021”. If you need the date “yesterday”, enter “-1d”.

If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From March 22, 2021 to March 28, 2021”. If you need the date “before 2 weeks”, enter “-2w”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From February 15, 2021 to February 28, 2021”. If you need the date ”after 3 months”, enter “+3m”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From June 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021”. If you need the date “before 3 months”, enter “-3m”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From December 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020”. If you need the date “after 1 year”, enter “+1y”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022”. If you need the date “before 1 year”, enter “-1y”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020”. Examples for entire periods: If you need “the last 7 days”, enter “-7d..0d”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From February 24, 2021 to March 2, 2021”. If you need “the next 7 days”, enter “0d..+7d”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From March 2, 2021 to March 9, 2021”. If you need “last week”, enter “-1w..-1w”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From February 24, 2021 to March 2, 2021”. If you need “this week”, enter “0w..0w”. If today were March 2, 2021 (Tuesday), it would translate to “From March 1, 2021 to March 7, 2021”. If you need “the last 3 months”, enter “-3m..-1m”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From December 1, 2021 to February 28, 2021”. If you need “the last 3 months to today”, enter “-3m..0d”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From December 1, 2020 to March 2, 2021”. Mixed expressions You can use more than absolute, relative and predefined expressions - the mixed expressions. For instance, you can set a starting date as one expression (example: predefined) and set an end date as another expression (example: relative) Examples: If you need the date to “from the beginning of last week to yesterday”, enter “(lw)..-1d”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From February 22, 2021 to March 1, 2021”. If you need the date to “from the beginning of March to the end of this week”, enter “3..(tw)”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From March 1, 2021 to March 7, 2021” If you need the date to “from today to the end of this month”, enter “0d..(tm)”. If today were March 2, 2021, it would translate to “From March 2, 2021 to March 31, 2021”. Graph editor You can set periods with the Graph editor for period expressions by setting start and end dates from a friendly calendar. You can access it by clicking the button with the arrow in the field “Period for XXXX”. The Graph editor is divided in 2 parts - left and right. The left part allows you to control the starting date and the right one - the end date. The two parts are identical. Each one has buttons for the months and years and above them - the current day, month and year: When you work with the Graph editor , you can press only one month button. If you haven’t pressed any button, this means that you haven’t selected a starting/ending month and the program takes the current one. The panel of the years is under the number pad for the months. It shows 4 years - 2 years before the current year, the current year, and one year after the current one. The two panels (left and right) show whether you have included the year at the starting and/or ending month or not. Example: If you need the period “from the beginning of January to the end of March”, enter “1” on the left and “3” on the right: If you need the period “from the beginning of January 2019 to the end of June 2021”, enter “1” and “19” on the left and “6” and “21” on the right:"

    "keywords": "Tablet view settings A key differentiator of ERP.net Windows Desktop Client is the opportunity to use an operating mode, suitable for touch devices . The system offers a three-stage “touch” optimization, which turns your tablet from a device for content consumption into a device that can be used for creating diverse cooperation information. This allows for the device to update, receive and report completion of tasks. You will be able to: track the entire required information for a project or the entire production chain; track specific tasks; check and supervise different processes’ completion state; as well as the condition of the machines, work force, production parts usage for a period of time; or get statistical analysis of the process management in real time. Working with a tablet has several settings and we recommend that you configure ahead of time. The forms which you will use have to be arranged in special views, suitable for touch devices. Here are the steps you have to take to create the according views: Create a new portrait view named Tablet. Arrange the panels in one region. The buttons for switching between the panels should be on the left. We recommend that you remove or move to the right the wide columns like names of products, warehouses, etc. if you are dealing with a panel with multiple rows In order to avoid having too many fields, you have to leave only the key ones or the ones you use the most. It’s best for the fields that you want to edit to be on the left, despite having the option to scroll down. You need to do this in order to avoid missing writing information in a field. We also recommend that you remove the buttons Navigation, Filter and Copy/Cut and Paste from File >> Settings . This way you will have a simpler view on the tablet. The idea is for the tablet view to be as clean as possible. It will look like this: We recommend that you select “Basic User” from the Optimization Menu. This way you can simplify the system for a more accessible outlook. We also recommend that you select the “Touch Only” mode in the same menu. The Windows keyboard must always show at the bottom of the screen as it is one of the most important requirements for using ERP.net Windows Desktop Client on mobile devices. After all of these settings are applied, here is how the Tablet view will look like: The view of the Product Navigator will also change, but it will still be well suited for the “Touch only” mode."

    "keywords": "Working with views When working with the system, you may need to see the same information in different ways depending on the use case. This is why you can customize the system form’s appearance for it to fit your current needs. To protect your time, you can save the customized appearance under a specific name so that you can open it again later. This is called a View. The View is a specific named appearance of a system’s form. You could have multiple Views for the same form and each of them could be easily opened with a single mouse click. To customize the View, you need to have the form in the Customize Current View mode and possess the needed rights (in the current article we assume that you have the rights to perform the described actions). Selecting the desired View is done by clicking it in the Command Ribbon >> View. There is a list at the left hand side with all saved views (if there are any). The View is changed by clicking on the desired View: When there are more saved Views than the section can show (4, or 2 when the window is smaller), then the whole list could be seen by clicking the button . View types ERP.net has different types of Views – Standard and Named, for a User, Role or All Users. There are two Standard Views – one for All Users and one for the specific User. In the Standard View it is recommended to save the View that is needed most often. The Named Views are used for special use cases and there could potentially be an unlimited (but still reasonable) amount of them. The Views, created by a User (in brackets behind the name of a View you can see the User who created it), could be opened and edited only by that specific User. They are not visible to the rest of the users in the system (including administrators). The Views, assigned to a Role (in the form “View name (Role name)”) could be opened and edited by any user, who has that role assigned or by an administrator. The All Users Views could be opened by all users of the system and edited only by administrators. Saving views You can save your modified View using one of the following methods – by clicking the “Save layout changes” button or by using the “Save current view as…” option. The function “Save layout changes” is used by clicking the respective button in the View tab of the Command Ribbon. This way the changes are saved in the currently selected View. When it is necessary to save the changes in a View, different than the currently selected one, you could use the option “Save current view as…” from the Command Ribbon >> View >> More >> Save current view as… This option opens a new dialog window where you can set your saving preferences. If you would like the View to be named, click the respective “Named Layout” checkbox and give it a name. Otherwise, the View will be saved as a Standard View. If the View is not specifically saved, the system would ask if you would like to save it when closing the form. If not, the changes would be lost. More actions Other actions you could potentially perform with Views (from the Command Ribbon >> View >> More) Delete current view – deletes the currently selected view. This function is irreversible Restore default view – restores the Standard view View permissions – allows you to view and/or change the View permissions System view permissions – allows you to view and/or change the System view permissions Panel permissions – allows you to view and/or change the Panel permissions Load layout from file – works when there is a previously saved layout. The system applies it to the currently selected View of the form.

An important detail here is that if the address is not constant (e.g. when you just want to open \"google.com\") and depends on certain parameters, then the string interpolation takes action - integrated functionality in ERP.net. In the example with the panel above that shows google maps, the source URL used is: https://www.google.com/maps/place/{Party.Area.Name:T} which is interpolated to: https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sofia That is, it doesn't simply visualize a location on the map, but one that is set on the customer itself. For more information on string interpolation you can read in our separate topic in the documentation . Source URL This is the original (source) target address that will be interpolated. Here you can specify additional parameters that are required (as the location in the example above). Of course, if you just type \"google.com\" and save the changes, this panel will simply open the site. HTTP headers Sometimes, usually for web services, you need to specify additional value(s) in the request header. E.g. a secret token, api key, etc... Here you can set all additional headers as they are required. Parameters Contains a list of possible parameters that you can use in the source URL. When you double-click on the desired one, it will be inserted where you are positioned in the source URL input. Destination URL Practically, the same one as the Source URL, but interpolated. This will be the actual URL, that web browser will open. Advanced example Some web services require multiple additional parameters, which must be passed in the URL. The picture below demonstrates it. The external web service in the example expects several parameters and prints them on the screen. We can obtain these parameters only via string interpolation. Take a closer look at picture below - the source URL and how it's interpolated. As you see, we need to pass the customer's id, its nationality, the database name and the name of the currently logged user. Here is the source URL (string interpolation ready): https://mywebservice.com?customerId={Id}&customerNationality={Party.Nationality.Name:T}&databaseName={$dbname}&loggedUser={$user.Name:T} And the result from the string interpolation: https://mywebservice.com?customerId=108aaf46-8371-452d-bf50-ddff75596ad6&customerNationality=Russian Federation&databaseName=DEMODB&loggedUser=John Smith"
