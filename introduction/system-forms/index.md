# System forms 

The <b>system forms</b> are a basic unit for showing and editing system data that comprise a group of fields. Тhey are used to display and enter information.

There are four types of system forms:

- Definition – a system form, in which you enter the characteristics of a single entity record i.e. definition (party, product, document type, etc.)
- Document – used when entering data for different documents (sales orders, invoices, etc.)
- Navigator/Report – a system form, which displays an extensive amount of information summarized in a table form.
- Specific – under this term, we summarize all system forms, which we cannot assign to any of the three categories above. Most often, they are forms, which pop up as a separate floating window. This window looks different than the classical system forms and is most often used for settings.

The working area (workspace) of the [system forms can be customised](https://docs.erp.net/winclient/introduction/system-forms/index.html?q=system%20forms%20can%20be%20customised) according to the specific needs.
