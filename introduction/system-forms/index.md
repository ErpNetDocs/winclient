# System forms 

The <b>system forms</b> are a basic unit for showing and editing system data that comprise a group of fields. You can use them for entering data or for displaying a reference screen for previously selected data.

There are four types of system forms:

- Definition – a system form, in which you enter the characteristics of a single entity record i.e. definition (party, product, document type, etc.)
- Document – used when entering data for different documents (sales orders, invoices, etc.)
- Navigator/Report – a system form, which displays an extensive amount of information summarized in a table form.
- Specific – under this term, we summarize all system forms, which we cannot assign to any of the three categories above. Most often, they are forms, which do not open on the workspace but as a separate floating window. This window looks different than the classical system forms and is most often used for settings.

You can also personalize the working area of the system forms. The working are of the system form
