# System Forms 

The <b>System Forms</b> are a basic unit for showing and editing system data that comprise a group of fields. You can use them for entering data or for displaying a reference screen for previously selected data.

There are four types of System Forms:

- Definition – a system form, in which you give characteristics to a definition (counterparty, product, type of document, etc.)
- Document – the one to use when entering data for different types of documents
- Navigator/Report – a system form, where you have a table with an extensive amount of information displayed
- Specific – under this term, we summarize all of those, which we cannot assign to any of the three categories above. Most often, they are forms, which do not open on the dashboard but in a separate window. This window looks different than the classical System Forms and is most often used for settings

You can also personalize the working area of the System Forms.
