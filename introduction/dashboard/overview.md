# Dashboard

The <b>Dashboard</b> shows the different system forms you will need when working with @@winclientfull.

See the ribbon on the top - it contains tabs with different commands (or buttons). Depending on what system Form is open (Document, Navigator/Reference or Definition) and what the positioning of the cursor is, the Command Ribbon will contain different pages with tools for managing the currently active Form.

The menu has 3 sections:

1. User help
- ![Documentation icon](pictures/documentation-icon.png) <b>Documentation</b> - holds the user manual for working with @@winclientfull. Another way to access the documentation is the hotkey F1 on your keyboard.
- ![What's new icon](pictures/what's-new-icon.png) <b>What’s New</b> - describes the new features of the system.
- ![Remote support icon](pictures/remote-support-icon.png) <b>Remote support</b> - access remote support through this icon.

2. System optimization
- ![Mouse and Keyboard](pictures/mouse-and-keyboard.png) <b>Mouse and Keyboard</b> – choose when working with a computer.
- ![Mouse, Keyboard and Touch](pictures/mouse-keyboard-and-touch.png) <b>Mouse, Keyboard and Touch</b> – choose when working with touch devices that are connected with a mouse and a keyboard.
- ![Touch Only](pictures/touch-only.png) <b>Touch Only</b> – choose with touchscreen devices, like smartphones or tablets. The higher access rights, the more options for working with the system.  

3. Interface complexity – every user has preset access rights. A user with higher privilege can ease his work by choosing a user with a lower one (for example Super User can choose to see the functionalities in the system as a Basic User). The options from sections <b>Optimize for use</b> and <b>User interface complexity</b> can be accessed through the File menu >> Settings.

## Language

![Language icon](pictures/language.png) Choose the language for the system by clicking on this icon.
English and Bulgarian are there by default, but the program allows you to add multiple other languages as well.
