# Paste rows functions


There are two new options in the right mouse button menu, available in version 2019.1:
- Paste rows (Ctrl - V)
When using this option, rows are pasted in a grid visually - row by row and field by field.
- Paste rows without on-screen validation (Ctrl - Shift - V) </br>
When using this option, rows are pasted in a grid, all at the same time.

The second option is accessible only for User interface complexity **Super user** and **Administrator**.

The configuration key **VisualPasteDisabled** has been suspended since version 2019.1 and it does not matter any more if it exists in registry and what its value is.
