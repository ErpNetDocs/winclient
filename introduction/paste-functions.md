# Paste rows functions

There are two new options in the right-mouse button menu, available in version 2019.1:

- **Paste rows** (Ctrl - V)

When using this option, rows are pasted in a grid visually - row by row and field by field.

- **Paste rows without on-screen validation** (Ctrl - Shift - V) </br>

When using this option, rows are pasted in a grid, all at the same time.

The second option is accessible only for user interface complexity **Super user** and **Administrator**.

The configuration key **VisualPasteDisabled** has been suspended since version 2019.1.
