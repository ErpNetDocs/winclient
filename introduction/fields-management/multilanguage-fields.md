# Multilanguage fields

Click on <b>Transliterate</b> and a list with the available languages will appear on the side.

The name of the product group displays in the first field (reserved for the main language).

To set transliteration in some of the listed languages, click on the <b>Transliterate</b> button, then choose ‘From Bulgarian’ (which will show the system's main language).
  
To set transliteration for all of the available languages, click on <b>Transliterate Current to Others</b> located on the bottom of the list.

<b>Note</b>:
- The <b>Transliterate</b> button is set to only work from English to Bulgarian and vice versa.
- Unless the <b>Transliterate</b> button is clicked upon, the multilanguage field will be written out using Latin (English) symbols when the system is switched from English to Bulgarian language.
- The <b>Transliterate</b> button allows for writing out initial text that can be edited afterwards.
