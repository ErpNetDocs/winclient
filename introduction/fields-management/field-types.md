## <b>Drop-down list field</b>
The field contains a drop-down list of predefined values, amongst which the customer can choose. It is not possible to enter values that are not included in the list.

There are three ways to search amongst the values this type of field displays:

- using the scrollbar located on the right side of the list. Preferable when the list is short.

- by typing the first letters of the text. The system will show all the values with names starting that way.  

- by entering a ‘space’ before a word the value has in its name. The ‘space’ would replace an indefinite number of symbols. Thus, the system would locate those values no matter where the word typed in the bar stands in the name. Take, as an example the ‘OOD’ abbreviation entered in the search bar with a ‘space’ before.The system would locate all the clients registered as a private limited company.

## <b>Drop-down list field with no predefined values</b>
This field contains a list of values, which are not predefined but recorded during previous work upon the same type of document. In other words, any value that has been entered in the current session will add up to the other values in the records, creating a list of suggested options, unless they double.

## <b>Checkbox</b>
The checkbox has three values – ‘checked’, ‘unchecked’ and ‘void’. When selected, a check appears in the box. If it is not selected, the box remains clear. If the box contains a grey square, this means there is no value for the field – it is neither ‘checked’, nor ‘unchecked’. To undo the cancellation, click on the icon ![xicon](pictures/xicon.png).

## <b>File Attachment field</b>

There are two ways to attach the file:
