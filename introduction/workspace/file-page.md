# File page

In the **File page**, you have quick access to: recently opened documents, opening documents by URL, centralized document creation, and user interface settings.

You can access the **File page** from any location in the program.

![File Menu](pictures/file-page.png) 

You will find that the **File page** is similar to the **Main menu** in its structure. On the left, you can open the sections, and on the right, you’ll see the elements of the chosen section.  

## Recently opened documents

By clicking the <b>Recent</b> button, you will see a list of the lately used forms:

![Recently opened documents](pictures/recent.png) 

You can easily access the documents again with a click on the desired document.

## Create new document

With the <b>Create</b> button, you have the option of central document creation from any location in the program. When you choose this function, you have a list of all document types. You can easily find the one you’re looking for, as we organize them into functional areas (just like in the **Main menu**):

![Create New Document](pictures/create-new-document.png) 

If you want to create a document, click on its name in the list.

## Open URL

With the <b>Open URL</b> button, you can directly open a document using its unique URL address:

![Open URL](pictures/open-url.png) 

You can receive or send the address through an e-mail, real-time communicators, etc. If you want to open a form using its URL, paste the address in the field on the right side of the screen and then click on the arrow (or press Enter). <br>
You can check the URL address in the <b>Properties</b> button.

## Close and save all

The <b>Close and save all</b> button allows you to close all opened forms with one click. It is ideal for when you have many forms opened at the same time:

![Close and save all](pictures/close-and-save-all.png) 

When you click on the button, the program attempts to close all forms. The forms that could be closed will be closed. <br>
In case that any of the forms requires your intervention (saving the view, having errors during saving), you will receive a notification. 

## Delete 

You can delete some of the forms (templates for documents routes, characteristics, etc.). To delete a form, click on the respective button:

![Delete](pictures/delete.png) 

## Log Off

The <b>Log Off</b> button allows you to end your work in the system. The program remains open, available for another user to log in with their credentials.

## Exit

With the <b>Exit</b> button, you end any work on the system and completely close the program.

## Print, Properties, Send

The *File page* is another place, where you can print a document, review its properties, or send it via e-mail. These buttons have analogs on the command ribbon. 

![Print, Properties, Send](pictures/print-properties-send.png) 

Using the <b>Send as attached PDF document</b> function, you can send a document with a single mouse click. It is also going to save the document as a temporary PDF file, using a default template for the printout. After that, an email will be created for you through the incorporated into @@winclientfull mail client. The letter already contains the attached file and receiver (we take the information from the contact data for the counterparty of the document). In case of a successfully generated letter, you will be able to see the operation, saved as a printout in the *Print* panel.

## Settings

You can personalize your workflow in the system according to your preferences or choose from the given preset options in the <b>Settings</b>.
