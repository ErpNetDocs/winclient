Here you can set which filters you need to be visible. Visible fields will have a checkmark next to their name:
 
![Show/hide filters](pictures/show-hide-filters.png)

The Filters with sub-filters in them will display with this arrow when hidden: ![Right arrow](pictures/right-arrow.png) and it will change when you expand them: ![Down arrow](pictures/down-arrow.png).
If one of the main filters isn’t visible, its sub-filters won’t be visible as well, no matter if you checked them or not.

You can also customize your filters by locking in a certain value in them.
