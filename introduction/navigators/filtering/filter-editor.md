You can match conditions with the keywords AND & OR. If you want the result to answer both conditions <b>simultaneously</b> (read it with the connective word “<b>and</b>”), use <b>AND</b>. If you want to see results, which answer <b>one of the two conditions</b> (read it with the connective word “<b>or</b>”), use <b>OR</b>.
