# Conditional coloring

<b>Conditional coloring</b> allows you to change the color and font in any field for the different reports, navigators, and document forms by a preset condition. It helps the visual comprehension of the information. You can set it for a single cell, the entire row, or a specific cell in an already colored row.

This way, for a start, in the <b>Sales Orders navigator</b>, you can set the New sales orders to get colored:

You can further color the fields, not entire rows, with an amount to pay greater than 7000:

The program prioritizes the color you set for a specific field over the color for the entire row, as shown on the picture above. Thanks to this, you can set reports colored by multiple criteria.<br>
You can also edit not only the color of the fields but also the size and font, the border color, etc. These additional settings are available in **Appearance** section of the **Format Condition tab** of *Field Properties*.
