# Navigators

The <b>Navigators</b> are system forms that show a lot of information in a summarized way. You can find them useful for visualization, managing, and editing data.

 Their <b>main functions</b> are:

- Better orientation in large amounts of data;
- Allowing сearching and opening documents or definitions;
- Filtering data by your criteria to narrow down the visible records; 
- Grouping and Summing data to extract total values;
- Sorting – setting an order for better organization;
- Searching in the data;
- Editing (adding, modifying, and removing) data;
- Mass data import – importing large amounts of data, from an outside source;
- An option for exporting data to Excel;
- An option for visualizing data in a graphic format;
- An option for defining reports;

You can use a Navigator to find answers to various questions. For example, *“Which product has the most sales?”, “Which customer provides the most income?”, “What are the financial results for the period?”* and so on. They provide you with a quick access to your data in the most practical order (filtered, grouped, or sorted) so that you can work only with the needed information. 

On the bottom left corner of the data panel, you will find buttons for navigating the Records. You can move between consecutive records from the results, from page to page, or jump directly to the first or last record.
