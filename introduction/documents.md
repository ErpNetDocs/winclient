# Documents

You can use the Documents in the system for entering information (Sales, Invoices, Payments, Warehourse Orders, etc.). The different types of Documents describe the ongoing processes in the company. The <b>Document Status</b> carries information about what <b>stage of completion</b> the process is currently in. It has a customizable variation – User Status. The system also allows you to review previous <b>versions</b> of the Document. Upon reaching a certain status, the Document flows, correspondent to the respective status, begin their execution. 
The Document flow contains all Documents created to this moment (for a single process).

The program groups the tabs, where you enter information, in separate units – Panels. The two panels, carrying the overall information – panel Document and the panel of the Document name (for example, for Document Sale – panel Sale, for Document Invoice – panel Invoice), form the so-called <b>“header”</b> of the Document. Usually, the header connects to the <b>lines</b> panel which can carry more detailed information. 

You can also edit an already created Document.
