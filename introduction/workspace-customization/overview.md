#Customize the Workspace

The workspace, i.e. the way the forms in the @@winclientfull look like, can be customized in order to serve specific needs - of a particular business process, a particular role or just a preference of a user. 
Those customized forms can be saved in so-called Views, which can be easily selected and switched during the work with the programs.
