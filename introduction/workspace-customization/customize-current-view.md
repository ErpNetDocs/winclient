# Customize Current View

The </b>Customize Current View</b> mode is used to edit the way System Forms look. You will find that mode deactivated by default when opening a Form. This way you can't move fixed tabs. The Customize Current View mode unlocks the following functions:

- Working with Views;
- Adding, removing, and resizing Regions;
- Adding, removing, and repositioning Panels;
- Adding, removing, repositioning, adjusting the Form and the color of the tabs;
- Adding or removing the short keys;
- Grouping and sorting;
- Setting default values;

Activate Customize Current View mode through <b>Command Ribbon >> View >> Customize Current View</b> (or with the short key <b>Ctr+L</b>) or automatically by choosing the <b>Customize Fields</b> option:

Before you exit the Form, you should save the View if you need to save the changes.
