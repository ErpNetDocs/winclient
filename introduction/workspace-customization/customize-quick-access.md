# Customize quick access

The command ribbon in @@winclientfull is designed in such a way so that the most used commands are the easiest to access. However, depending on your business, you will find different functions most useful. Thatâ€™s why you can set quick access buttons, that will stay attached to the *quick access* toolbar of the program, regardless of what section you are currently in (and it remains persistent for that form and user). 

## Add to quick access toolbar

1. Enter the *Customize Current View* mode; 
2. Right click on the desired button in the command ribbon;
3. From the drop menu choose **Add to quick access toolbar**:

## Position the Quick access toolbar

Depending on your preferences, you can position the quick access toolbar above or below the command ribbon. To do that:

You can show the quick access toolbar above the ribbon in a similar way.
