# Customize Quick Access

The Command Ribbon in @@winclientfull is designed in such a way so that the most used commands are the easiest to access. However, depending on your business, you will find different functions most useful. That’s why you can set Quick Access buttons, that will stay attached to the <b>Quick Access Toolbar</b> of the program, regardless of what section you are currently in (and it remains persistent for that Form and User). 

## Add to Quick Access Toolbar

1. Enter the Customize Current View mode; 
2. Right click on the desired button in the Command Ribbon;
3. From the drop menu choose “Add to Quick Access Toolbar”:
