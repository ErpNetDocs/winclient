# Working with Regions

The <b>Regions</b> are the places on the Dashboard containing Panels. You can change their size and position for each System Form separately. <br>
To personalize the Regions, you need to have <b>Customize Current View</b> mode activated.

![Regions](pictures/regions.png) 

In every Region, you have the option to position one or multiple panels.

You can add, remove, extend, or shrink the Regions. You can also add more Regions with this arrow ![Arrow](pictures/arrow.png).

If you need to remove a Region, you can use the separation line between the two panels. ![Separation line](pictures/separation-line.png) 

## Create a new Region

1. Hover over the arrow at the top or right corner to create a new Region ![Arrow](pictures/arrow.png). The cursor will change;

3. Release the mouse button and you will see the Region created.

3. Release the line and the Region will change.

## Fixing a Region

When resizing Regions (and also resizing the window of the @@winclientfull), you set which Region will change its size and which one will remain with a fixed size. 
Visually we show this with the button ![Fixing button](pictures/fixing-button-up.png) at the top right corner, and respectively ![Fixing button down](pictures/fixing-button-low.png) at the bottom left corner. 
The tips of the arrows point at the panel with the fixed size. To change that:

1. Hover over the respective button (at the top right or bottom left): ![Fixing button](pictures/fixing-button-up.png)
2. The mouse cursor will change â€“ the black arrow indicates the fixed Region: ![Change fixing button](pictures/change-fix-button.png)
3. When you click with the mouse (without moving it), you can choose which Region to leave as fixed: ![Changed fixing button](pictures/changed-fix-button.png)
You can check the fixed Region when you shrink the whole program window. See which Regions change in size and which don't.
