# Working with regions

The *regions* are places on the workspace that contain [panels](https://docs.erp.net/winclient/introduction/workspace-customization/working-with-panels.html). You can change their size and position for each system form separately. <br>
To personalize the regions, you need to have *Customize Current View* mode activated.

![Regions](pictures/regions.png) 

In every region, you have the option to position one or multiple panels.

You can add, remove, extend, or shrink the regions. You can also add more regions with this arrow ![Arrow](pictures/arrow.png).

If you need to remove a region, you can use the separation line between the two panels. ![Separation line](pictures/separation-line.png) 

## Create a new region

1. Hover over the arrow at the top or right corner to create a new region ![Arrow](pictures/arrow.png). The cursor will change;

2. Click on the button and drag down or to the left, until you reach the size you need. This will take up space from the region you dragged towards; 
3. Release the mouse button and you will see the region created.

3. Release the line and the region will change.

## Fix a region

When resizing regions (and also resizing the window of the @@winclientfull), you set which region will change its size and which one will remain with a fixed size. 
Visually we show this with the button ![Fixing button](pictures/fixing-button-up.png) at the top right corner, and respectively ![Fixing button down](pictures/fixing-button-low.png) at the bottom left corner. 
The tips of the arrows point at the panel with the fixed size. To change that:

1. Hover over the respective button (at the top right or bottom left): ![Fixing button](pictures/fixing-button-up.png)
2. The mouse cursor will change â€“ the black arrow indicates the fixed region: ![Change fixing button](pictures/change-fix-button.png)
3. When you click with the mouse (without moving it), you can choose which region to leave as fixed: ![Changed fixing button](pictures/changed-fix-button.png)
You can check the fixed region when you shrink the whole program window. See which regions change in size and which don't.
