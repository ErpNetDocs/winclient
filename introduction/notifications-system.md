# Notifications system 

The notifications system in @@name informs users about current or upcoming events. Notifications may be prompted for:
- new emails
- reminders for tasks that need to be done
- incoming calls

For notifications to be received, *Notifications settings* must be **enabled**.

Upon entering the system, notifications will pop up for new emails, incoming calls or expired tasks.

Once a notification is clicked, a document related to the event opens up. It could be an **email**, an **activity** document or a record for the **subject** (for incoming calls).

If the user does not open the notifications right away, they move above the command ribbon and become icons. Their appearance depends on the type of the event. 

The icon disappears after it's opened.

In case the user wants to ignore the received notification, the command *Dismiss all* must be **selected**.
