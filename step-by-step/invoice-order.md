# Invoice Order

An Invoice order is an **intermediate document** between a [Sale Order](https://github.com/ErpNetDocs/winclient/blob/master/step-by-step/sales-order.md) and an Invoice. 

It indicates that an **invoice** must be created. 

The standard model of work is to **generate** an Invoice Order from the [Sale Order](https://github.com/ErpNetDocs/winclient/blob/master/step-by-step/sales-order.md).

When creating the document, the rows from the Sale Order are automatically **copied** to the rows of the Invoice Order.

As a result, we get an **Invoice document**.
