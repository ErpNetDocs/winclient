# Invoice Order

An invoicing order is an intermediate document between a Sale Order and an Invoice. 

It indicates that an invoice must be created. 

The standard model of work is to generate an Invoice Order from the Sale Order. When creating the document, the rows from the Sale are automatically copied to the rows of the Invoice Order. An Invoice document type is created from it.
