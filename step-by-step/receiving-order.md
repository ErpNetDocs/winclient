# Receiving Order

A Receiving Order document **reflects** purchases made by a supplier and aims to **increase** availability. 

Most often, it is created **as a result** of a [Purchase Order](https://github.com/ErpNetDocs/winclient/blob/master/step-by-step/purchase-order.md).

To create a Receiving Order, go to <b>Logistics >> Procurement >> Create New Receiving Order</b>.
