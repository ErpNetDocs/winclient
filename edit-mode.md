# Edit Mode

There is a big difference between the *Change Current View* mode and the *Edit* mode. The *Change Current View* mode is used to set the way forms appear, while *Edit* mode is about the information (data). Activating the Edit Mode allows you to edit that information. The two modes are not interconnected. You have separate access for them so that *Change Current View* mode could be off while *Edit* mode is on or vice versa (furthermore, both modes could be active or not). 

By default, Documents open with active *Edit* mode, while Navigators and Definitions open with the mode deactivated. You can set all Forms to open with active *Edit* mode automatically, if needed. You need Edit Mode to be active to change the information in the forms. You can activate or deactivate the mode in the <b>Command ribbon >> Home >> Edit mode</b> (or with hotkey <b>F2</b>).

Note that not all navigators have *Edit* mode (Sales, Invoices, etc.).
